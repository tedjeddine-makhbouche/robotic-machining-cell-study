# Robotic Machining Cell

This project presents the design and control architecture of a robotic machining cell for an automotive subcontractor.

## Context
The objective is to improve flexibility and productivity by integrating new machining centers and optimizing loading and unloading operations.

## Proposed Solution
- FANUC M-20iA/20M industrial robot
- Three machining centers (A, B and C)
- Conveyor-based material flow
- Two operators dedicated to logistics
- Hierarchical and distributed control architecture

## Study Content
- Functional analysis (SADT A0, A1, A2)
- Comparison of human, automated and robotic solutions
- Chronogram of the production cycle
- Control-command architecture
- GRAFCET models (supervision, robot, machines and conveyors)

## Tools
- FANUC RoboGuide
- GRAFCET / SADT methodology

## Status
Academic engineering case study.
